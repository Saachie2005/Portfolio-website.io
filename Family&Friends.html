                around me with my whole <br>
                heart. I would do anything for<br>
                my friends and family. Having <br>
                so many friends becomes a <br>
                task sometimes keeping in <br>
                mind to meet all of them. <br>
                However, they bring joy to my<br>
                life. Having so many friends<br>
                does not mean I do not spend<br>
                time with my family. My bond<br>
                with my family is stronger than<br>
                anyone could imagine. I would<br>
                not be who I am without them.
